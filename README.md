## Hello!

My name is Patrick. I am a graduate student and open source enthusiast. While my interests are varied, I primarily work on compilers and language tools. Please see my website for more information: [https://patrickflynn.xyz](https://patrickflynn.xyz)

**Important**:
I am moving all my personal projects and development off Github. Work and school-related stuff will stay here. You can find everything here: [https://codeberg.org/patrickf2000](https://codeberg.org/patrickf2000), and I also have an account here (unused at the moment): [https://gitlab.com/patrickf2000](https://gitlab.com/patrickf2000).
